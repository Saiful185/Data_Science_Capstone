    "Air Pollution is a burning problem nowadays,especially in urban areas. So It is necessary to examine what is responsible for poor air quality. A good way to do that is to determine what differentiates the cities with Least polluted air from those with Most polluted air. In this project we've used population data and the internal surroundings of 16 such cities to determine what the difference is between the two groups. This study pretty much concerns every one, Because of the fact that everyone consumes air and is effected by it. **But the primary audience of this study is the City authorities and Urban Planners who are responsible for designing and Planning the structure of a city**,so that they have an insight on what could possibly lead to a City which is Pollution free."

The lists of most polluted and least polluted cities will be used as reference. From these, we will use the 8 most polluted and 8 least polluted cities to compare the common venues within the cities retrieved from Foursquare location data and the population densities of the cities got from Wikipedia and other sources.

    "3. Getting the Latitude & Longitude values of the cities using Python geocoder library an putting all the data in a dataframe.\n",
    "4. Finding out all the nearby venues within a certain radius in each city,categorizing them & putting all the results in a dataframe.\n",
    "5. Finding out the most common venues from each city using Python pandas toolkit.\n",
    "6. Comparing the common venues to find out if there is any pattern of differences between the most & least polluted cities.\n",

    "#### Second Stage:\n",
    "1. Gathering the population densities of all the listed cities and creating a dataframe using this data.\n",
    "2. Creating a visualization of the population data using the dataframe, separating most polluted & least polluted cities.\n",
    "3. Using the visualization,finding out if higher population density in cities corresponds to more pollution."

    "1. One important drawback of analyzing with common location data is that **it doesn't account for relative weights of the venues**. For example it gives equal weight to a tannery and a coffee shop. But clearly a tannery is a way more significant venue than a coffee shop,specially in our case. **So it is recommended to address this issue in future studies and if possible come up with a way to single out important venues like tanneries or factories.**\n",
    "2. The radius limitation gives rise to a problem too. In many cases the entities responsible for air pollution are situated at the edge of the cities. So our analysis can't properly include them. **It is recommended to address this issue in future studies too.**\n",
    "3. In case of population density, even though in most cases a higher population density means more pollution, there are some pretty significant outliers too. For example Honolulu has a way higher population density than Hotan despite being much less polluted. So clearly population density alone can't explain pollution. Other factors, like Waste Management systems should be considered as pointed out in our data sources. **It is recommended to study what other factors in a city leads to more pollution in future works.**"

    "In this study, a comprehensive approach was taken to study what factors are behind air pollution in many cities. Analyzing location,common venues and population data of **8 Most Polluted** & **8 Least Polluted** cities, we can share at least 2 concluding remarks:\n",
    "1. **The most common structures and venues within a city are pretty much the same in most of them and they have little effect in making a city a polluted one. Some significant venues might seem to be exceptions but the regular surroundings have little to no impact in this case, hence uncorrelated to pollution.** \n",
    "2. **Even though there can be many other factors, Densely populated cities tend to be more polluted than less densely populated cities. So, there is a positive correlation between population density & pollution.**\n",
    "\n",
    "City authorities and Urban planners should take note of these remarks,plan accordingly and there should be further study in order to solve the problem of air pollution in big cities."
